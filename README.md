# Attached is my submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge for Summer 2022.
The web application uses a React front end to render the graphical userface, NodeJS for the backend and MongoDB for the database. 

# How to setup and install the application:
1. Install NodeJS.
2. Navigate to the inventory-tracker folder. Open a terminal, and install the program dependencies using npm install.
3. Install MongoDB. You can download MongoDB Community Server, at mongodb.com. Once it is installed, install the MongoDB JavaScript driver: npm install mongodb.
4. In the same terminal enter the keyword: mongo. Once inside the MongoDB shell, initialize the database by entering: load("initdb.mongo").
5. Start the React application by typing: npm start.
6. Start the server by typing: nodemone server.js.
7. The web application will be visible through: http://localhost:3000
